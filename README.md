## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate Computer Scientist and Software Developer, specializing in building robust, scalable backend systems with a focus on Ruby on Rails. With years of hands-on experience in both greenfield and legacy projects, I thrive on solving complex architectural problems and optimizing for maintainability and performance.

- 🏢 **Current Focus:** Building data-driven applications with Ruby on Rails, leveraging SQL Server (MSSQL) for enterprise-level reliability.
- 🏠 **Based in:** Cross-platform world (Mac OS as my daily driver, Ubuntu for devops tasks, always with a Mac keyboard).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Ruby, Go, Java, SQL (SQL Server), JavaScript, Bash, HTML5, CSS3, YAML, Markdown
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Ruby on Rails, Minitest, FactoryBot, Hotwire, React (for occasional frontend spikes)
- **Database:** SQL Server (MSSQL), PostgreSQL (sometimes), Redis (for caching/queues)
- **Dev Tools:** Git, Docker, VS Code, tmux, iTerm2, Zsh
- **Testing:** Minitest + FactoryBot
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, CircleCI
- **OS:** Mac (primary), Ubuntu Linux (secondary)
